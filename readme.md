🧠 Projects Repository

Welcome to my Projects Repository!
This is where I’ll collect all of my programming projects as I grow and learn in different areas of software development.

I’m starting with Python, which I explore in my dedicated folder: PythonLab/ 🐍
Over time, I’ll add projects in other languages and technologies as I expand my skills.

Stay tuned — this repo will evolve as my journey continues. 🚀
